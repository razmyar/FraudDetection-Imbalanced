![](/home/soroush/Develope/github_temp/FraudDetection/imgs/imb.png) 
E-commerce websites often transact huge amounts of money. Whenever a huge amount of money is moved, there is a high risk of users performing fraudulent activities, e.g. using stolen credit cards, laundering money, etc. 

**Goal:** To build a machine learning model for an e-commerce company that predicts the probability that the first transaction of a new user is fraudulent.

**Constrains:** 

1- Incorrectly flagging a real transaction as fraudulent (False Alarm Cost): $8.00  
2- Failing to identify a fraudulent transaction (Fraud Loss): Average product values
